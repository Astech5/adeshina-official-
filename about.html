  <h1> Welcome to my Profile </h1>
  <h2> About me </h2>
  <p>Hello, I am Adeshina Olanrewaju, Product and User Experience Designer. I perfectly balance user and business needs to create delightful products. Creating user engaging and immersive applications has always been a longstanding ambition of mine, I focus on designing complex and functional web and mobile products for B2C and B2B organizations. Finding ways to communicate to users in a visually and cohesively inviting way, is important to me. I am adept at handling multiple design projects in a fast paced environment. Excellent at time management, organization, problem solving and meeting deadlines.
  </p><br>
  <h2>  LIFE OUTSIDE WORK </h2>
  <p> 
    Inspiration for my designs comes from living an active fun-filled life. Hanging out with friends, and creating memories with people are things I love and are important to me. My ever-inquisitive mind pushes me to explore knowledge in preaching the words of God and I love travelling too. Oh, one more thing! It's no mystery why my friends call me 'mentor! I am definitely good to lid in prayers and settle conflics amongs couple/peoples.
  </p><br>
  <h2> MY PRINCIPLES </h2>
<p> 
  I combine the freedom of personality, diligence and integrity to design accessible and usable products. Striving daily to offer the best digital design solutions to users and organizations. I collaborate closely with a diverse team, and devote my heart and souls to my works, and the outcomes speak for themselves.</p>
